the average number of cylinder swept is mush lower than Demo.jar, since, it implements the FIFO strategy, it didn't minimize the seek time,
so, the arm will keep moving.
However, in my project, SSTF is implemented, the selected IORB from the QUEUE is the shortest seek time. the arm in this case, doesn't move that much.

in the case of Service time per I/O, because the seeking time is minimized, the total service time is minimized.
